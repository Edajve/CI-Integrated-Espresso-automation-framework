# Robert-Bosse-Espresso-Test-Framework
This is a testing framework that uses shell scripts to intergrate into a CI Jenkins job, 
Using Esperesso for Android React-Native testing on front end components.
This project connects to a test management service called Test Lodge, and it would be used to integrate into the CI job based on the test
cases in Test Lodge, and return the results both in an HTML report and into test lodge for manual testers to be updated on their end.
